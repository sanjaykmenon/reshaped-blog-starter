### Public speaking

I used to get butterflies just thinking about speaking in front of others, but now, you'll often find me sharing my coding adventures and front-end tips at meetups and webinars. It's been quite the journey from nervous wreck to someone who actually enjoys the spotlight. Every talk, with its own set of hiccups and high fives, has helped me get better at breaking down tricky topics into fun, digestible bits. Honestly, it's pretty cool to connect with folks who geek out over the same stuff I do, and I'm all about making tech talks as enjoyable as a chat over coffee.
